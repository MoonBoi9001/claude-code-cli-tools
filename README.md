## Quick Setup (< 1 minute)

### Step 1: Install Commands (one time only)

```bash
# Clone and install in one command:
git clone https://github.com/MoonBoi9001/claude-code-cli-tools.git && \
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && \
cp -ri claude-code-cli-tools/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

**Or manually:** Download this repo as ZIP, create `~/.claude/commands/`, and copy all files from the `commands` folder there.

### Step 2: Set Up Each Project (30 seconds)

In any project where you want to use these commands:

```bash
# Run this one command:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonBoi9001/claude-code-cli-tools/main/SESSION_CONTEXT.md -o SESSION_CONTEXT.md && \
[ -s CLAUDE.md ] && echo -e "\n" >> CLAUDE.md || true; \
echo -e "# Session Context Import\n@./SESSION_CONTEXT.md" >> CLAUDE.md && \
grep -q "SESSION_CONTEXT.md" .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo "SESSION_CONTEXT.md" >> .gitignore
```

This command:
- Downloads SESSION_CONTEXT.md 
- Adds the import to your CLAUDE.md (creates it if needed)
- Adds SESSION_CONTEXT.md to .gitignore (creates it if needed)

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ Start using `/recap`, `/commit`, `/create-pr` and more.
