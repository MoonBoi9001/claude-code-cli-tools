# Subagent Prompting Guide

## Critical Context Principle
Subagents start with ZERO context about the current project, problem, or conversation. They cannot ask clarifying questions - they work with what you provide. The quality of their output directly correlates with the completeness of your prompt.

**Golden Rule**: Include everything a new team member would need to understand and solve the problem independently.

## üö® Common Prompting Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Vague
```
@research-specialist: Research WebSocket best practices
```

### ‚úÖ Properly Contextualized
```
@research-specialist: Research WebSocket best practices for real-time chat

Context:
- Building: Real-time chat for customer support
- Scale: 10k concurrent connections expected
- Stack: Node.js backend, React frontend
- Constraints: Single server initially, AWS hosting

Research needed:
- Scaling strategies for 10k+ connections
- Security best practices for WebSocket
- Reconnection and error handling patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
```

### ‚ùå Missing Current State
```
@strategic-executive: Should we use microservices?
```

### ‚úÖ Complete Context
```
@strategic-executive: Evaluate microservices migration

Current situation:
- Monolithic Django app, 5 years old
- 50k daily active users, growing 20% monthly
- Team: 6 developers, strong Python, no DevOps
- Pain points: Deploy time (2 hours), scaling specific features

Investment required:
- 6-month migration estimate
- Need to hire 2 DevOps engineers
- $30k/month additional infrastructure

Success criteria: Reduce deploy time, independent scaling
Risk tolerance: Medium - need to maintain uptime
```
