### 5. Commit
When you want Claude to automatically commit code changes with an appropriate message:

`/commit`

**Commit workflow (all steps REQUIRED):**
1. **üö® MANDATORY SAFETY CHECK**: Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`
   - **IMMEDIATELY REFUSE** if on `main` branch - commits to main are NEVER allowed
   - Display error: "‚ùå ERROR: Cannot commit to main branch. Please create a feature branch first."
   - Stop execution completely - do not proceed with any other steps
2. Run `git diff` to analyze changes
3. Perform comprehensive change analysis:
   - **Identify primary purpose**: What is the main goal of these changes?
   - **Detect new capabilities**: Look for added functions, methods, options, or features
   - **Recognize patterns**:
     - New lines starting with numbers often indicate new steps/features in documentation
     - Added conditionals/validations often indicate new constraints or safeguards
     - New parameters/options suggest enhanced functionality
   - **Weigh significance**: Features > fixes > improvements > refactors > docs > style
4. Automatically detect the commit type (feat/fix/docs/chore/refactor/test):
   - feat: New functionality or capabilities added
   - fix: Bug fixes or corrections
   - docs: ONLY if changes are purely documentation with no functional impact
   - refactor: Code restructuring without changing functionality
   - test: Adding or modifying tests
   - chore: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
5. Generate a descriptive commit message that:
   - **Title**: Max 50 characters (imperative mood: "Add", not "Added")
   - Highlights the most impactful change
   - Explains what was added/changed and why (when apparent)
   - Keeps secondary changes in the body, not the title
6. Execute the git commit
7. **üö® MANDATORY: MUST update session context** `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` (runs `/update-session`) with commit details - DO NOT skip this step

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDER: Every /commit command MUST end with updating SESSION_CONTEXT.md - this is not optional!**

Example usage:

```text
Human: /commit
Claude: [analyzes changes and creates commit]
Commit: abc1234 - feat: Add new feature

‚úÖ MANDATORY STEP: Updating session context with commit details...
Session context updated with implementation progress.
```

**Prerequisites**:

- Staged or unstaged changes to commit
- Git repository initialized
